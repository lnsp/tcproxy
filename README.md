# tcproxy

This repository contains tcproxy, a simple TCP reverse proxy. In the future it may be extended to be able to proxy more
than just TCP and support more advanced features such as the PROXY Protocol.

## Roadmap

- [x] Support forwarding TCP connections
- [x] Perform Round-Robin load balancing
- [ ] Support sticky sessions
- [ ] Add PROXY protocol option
- [ ] Extend support to UDP and Unix sockets
